## Business Problem 💡

Akash (an airline company) has been providing high-quality air transportation service to their clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for their 
passengers. They operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, they are currently facing challenges due to various 
factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor 
costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and they are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this 
challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned 
per seat.
