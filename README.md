# Airlines Data Analysis ✈️🧑‍✈️

## Business Problem 💡

Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our 
passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various 
factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor 
costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this 
challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned 
per seat.

## Key Obstacles ⚠️
🛑 <b>Stricter environmental regulations</b>: The airlines industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent
    environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also restrict the potential for expansion.

🛑 <b>Higher flight taxes</b>: Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft as a means to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. This increase in
    flight taxes has raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

🛑 <b>Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs</b>: The aviation sector is experiencing a scarcity of skilled workers, leading to higher labor costs and an increase
    in turnover rates.
